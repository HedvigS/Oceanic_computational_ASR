##Basics

This is a set of R scripts and one python scripts that take data on grammatical features of Oceanic languages (from Grambank) and predicts what value those features would have in proto-languages given two specific trees: Glottolog tree and Gray et al 2009-tree. Particular attention is paid to Proto-Oceanic, Proto-Central Pacific, Proto-Polynesian and Proto-Eastern Polynesian. These predictions of the grammar of proto-languages are compared to findings in classical historical linguistics and are used to computer convservatism scores for languages.

#To note
These scripts are set up to be run either from the command line or within Rstudio. The scripts are specifically fetching Grambank data as found in the clone of grambank/grambank-cldf
