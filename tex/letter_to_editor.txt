Dear Diachronica editors, 

Thank you for this opportunity to resubmit my paper on Oceanic grammar reconstruction. I have read the reviewers comments, and I also additionally sought comments from my PhD supervisor Andrew Pawley as he happened to be interested in this product from my PhD. I have addressed the reviewers concerns, I provide a summary below.

One of the reviewers remarked that the paper in its current form is too long, that what is currently in the supplementary material as tables in the PDF could be stored somewhere else. I'm open to this of course. Before I shorten it, I wanted your recommendations as editors as to what you prefer. I can use Zenodo, OSF-projects or other platforms and I can put all Supplementary Material there or only some. Please let me know what is best for your journal.
